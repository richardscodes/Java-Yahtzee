v1.0 (Rel. 11/12/20)
    - Initial version of game

    - Handles rolling 5 random die

    - Basic menuing system

    - Handles user choice of what to do after a roll


v1.0.1 (Rel. 11/16/20)
    - Cleaned and refactored some code for better readability

    - Added new empty classes & packages for future use

    - Starting a new game now (crudely) clears the console screen for the sake of
      less clutter

    * Fixed a bug in the menuing system where if the user
      exited a game and started a new game, the value
      of the 5 die would equal what it was the first time they
      played

    * Fixed a bug that would prematurely end the game if the
      user chose to re-roll a specific dice
